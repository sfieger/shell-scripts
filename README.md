# misc-scripts
Collection of miscellaneous scripts I cobbled together (or found on the internet and edited how I needed them) to acomplish things on different machines.

Some of them use a slightly modified script-template of [m-radzikowski](https://gist.github.com/m-radzikowski/53e0b39e9a59a1518990e76c2bff8038) published under MIT License.

## Debian (and probably Ubuntu)
- check-updates  : checks and prints how many packages are upgradeable
- backup-local   : uses rsync to backup files to a usb-drive using the towers of hanoi strategy

# Installation
Copy the scripts to wherever you like, make them runnable (chmod +x) and have a try.
